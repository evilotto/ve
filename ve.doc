          _V_e is a screen oriented empire(6) tool to aid in decision
          making and command file creation.  It has been used by
          kings, presidents and petty dictators in many different
          countries and worlds with varying degrees of success.  The
          program runs independently of empire and can thus be used as
          much and whenever you wish.

          _V_e takes as input any number of empire commodity, census,
          map, spy, ship, radar, coastwatch, cargo, lookout, cutoff,
          level, satellite, unit, llookout, lcargo, dump and special
          reports. _V_e combines the information and displays a map on
          the screen and the census and commodity information for that
          sector at the bottom.  As you move your cursor from one
          sector to the next the information at the bottom is updated.
          You can do surveys of the land, mark sectors and save
          commands in a separate command file to be executed later in
          empire.

          If the -_a option is used the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d__f_i_l_e is appended to
          whereas the -_c option will create or truncate the file.

          The -_p specifies a different profile file.

          Foreign country sectors are highlighted if the terminal
          supports this.

          The following are the commands that are understood (if not
          quite executed) by _v_e.


          q    Quit _v_e.

          v    Give version number and authors.



          Entering information:
               Many commands in _v_e will prompt you for more
               information at the bottom ("last line") of the screen.
               The following characters have a special meaning when

               entering information.


          BS   The backspace key will erase one character using a
               backspace-space-backspace sequence.

          @    The @ key will erase the entire line.

          ESC  The ESCape key will move the cursor from the bottom
               line to its current map position, wait a second and
               then jump back.

          .    The period will immediately expand to the x and y
               coordinates of the current sector.  A `.' embedded into
               macros will get expanded when the macro is.

          ^P   Proposed movements may be traced on the screen and
               allow you to verify moves and nav's by using the ^P
               command.

          backslash
               The backslash, `\' will cause the next character to be
               interpreted literally.  This is how `.'s are embedded
               into macros and how one keeps a macro from expanding.

          macros
               Macros are a single character that will expand to a
               string as soon as they are entered.  The commands to
               set and delete macros are described below.



          Movement and display functions:
               The following commands control the movement of the
               cursor on the screen and the printing of the status
               lines and and display.

          yugjbn
               Move one sector in the specified direction.  These are
               the same as in empire (up and left, up and right, left,
               right, down and left, down and right respectively).

          ^Y|^U
               Move/scroll up.

          ^B|^N
               Move/scroll down.

          ^G   Move/scroll left.

          ^J   Move/scroll right.

          l    Leap to a specified sector.  _V_e will prompt for the x
               and y coordinates of the sector.

          P    Toggle the printing of the status lines at the bottom
               of the screen (for slow baud rates).  Normally _v_e will
               update the status lines every time the cursor is moved,
               but with printing turned off, the status lines are only
               printed by the `p' command below.

          p    Print the status lines for that sector.  Only useful if
               printing has been toggled off.

          ^F   Flip between the survey map and the designation maps.

          ^L   Redraw the screen.

          ^R   Redraw the screen, centering it on the current
               position.

          D    Dump out the gathered data to a set of database files.
               These are currently a map file, a census file & a
               commodity file. These files can be automatically read
               in and written out with the correct profile variables.
               This enables a database to be kept of the current
               empire status. The default files are listed at the end.


          Marking the map:
               The result of a `?' command is to mark sectors of the
               map.  Sectors are marked using the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _m_a_r_k
               character. This can be changed without affecting the
               screen allowing for multiple marks on the same screen.
               A sector is marked by placing the current mark
               character (default is `>') directly to the left of the
               sector.  As an example of multiple marks, you can set
               the current mark to `^' and do the command "?civ>100"
               then set the mark to `v' and do "?civ<5" to get a
               visual representation of the high and low civilian
               population sectors.

          m    Set the current mark character.

          M    Reset the mark character to the default of `>'.

          c    Clear the current marks on the screen.

          C    Clear ALL of the marks on the screen.



          Command file:
               The optional command file can be used to store notes or

               commands to later be executed by empire.  _V_e lets you
               append to the file, change or create it and edit it
               without exiting the program.

          a    Append a line to the command file.

          o    Create or change the current command file.  If there is
               a current command file it is closed before the new file
               is opened.

          O    The same as above, except it zero's the file first.

          V    Invoke the default visual editor (normally _v_i(_1)) on
               the current command file.  The shell variable VISUAL
               will be used if set.

          E    Invoke the default line editor (normally _e_x(_1)) on the
               current command file.  The shell variable EDITOR will
               be used if set.



          _V_e Commands

          ?    This command will prompt you for an expression similar
               to that in empire (see Command Syntax in the empire
               manual).  The effect of all `?' commands is to "mark"
               sectors that satisfy the requirements of the command.
               Unfortunately the command is not as robust as it is in
               empire. In particular, the item name must be on the
               left while the value is on the right.

               Some allowed commands would be
                    ?civ>100&mil<5
                    ?country=4
                    ?des=h&lcm<20
                    ?dust     [equivalent to ?dust#0]
               The items that can be accessed are:
                    civ            civilians
                    mil            military

               Note that the above are the minimal abbreviations for
               the different items.

          I    The I command allows more report files to be read in.
               This is useful when combined with the ! command to
               update your empire and look at the results without ever
               exiting _V_e.

          !    The ! command forks a shell (honors the SHELL
               variable).  The command file is flushed before forking
               to allow its use.



          Macros:
               A macro is a single character that will be expanded
               immediately as typed it does not need to be space
               delimited.  A `.' may be embedded into a macro and will
               be expanded at the time the macro is typed.  For
               example, a C could be defined as "mov civ .".  Then
               whenever a C is typed it would expand to "mov civ x,y"
               where x,y are the coordinates of the current sector.

          s    Set up a macro.

          d    Delete a macro.



          Surveys of the land
               It is possible to survey any appropriate item on the
               commodity or census list.  A survey has a _r_a_n_g_e
               associated with it which describes the maximum value
               for the item being surveyed.  When the survey is done
               each sector is replaced by a single digit from 0 to 9
               which indicates which tenth of the range the value of
               that item occurred in.  For values greater than the



     Page 5                                          (printed 4/13/93)

               range capital letters are used up to `Z'.  After that
               only a `$' is printed.  The survey map is distinct from
               the designation map.  You can flip between the two at
               any time by typing `^F'.  For example, if the range is
               100, the item being surveyed is civilians and the
               number of civilians in the sector is 25, a 2 will be
               displayed.

          S    Perform a survey

          R    Set up the range for surveys.



          Naval reports
               Normally, your opponents navies as well as your own
               will not be displayed.  The ship display may be turned
               on using the 'N' command.  At this point, the flagship
               of each sector which contains a ship will be displayed
               in the sector in which it resides.  Information about
               each ship in a sector may be obtained by moving your
               cursor over the top of the sector and paging through
               each ship with the '+', '-', and '/' keys.

          N    Toggles the ship display mode.

          G    Go to the sector of the specified ship.  _V_e will prompt
               for the ship number.



          Unit reports
               This works the same as naval reports, but with units.
               The unit display may be turned on using the 'U'
               command.  At this point, the lead unit of each army
               will be displayed in the sector in which the unit
               resides.  Information about each unit in a sector may
               be obtained by moving your cursor over the top of the
               sector and paging through each unit with the '+', '-',
               and '/' keys.

          U    Toggles the unit display mode.

          B    Go to the sector of the specified unit.  _V_e will prompt
               for the unit number.



          Air Force reports
               Air Force reports work much like naval reports, except
               that the information is for planes instead of ships.
               The plane display may be turned on using the 'A'

               command.  At this point, the lead plane of each flight
               wing will be displayed in the sector in which the plane
               resides.  Information about each plane in a sector may
               be obtained by moving your cursor over the top of the
               sector and paging through each plane with the '+', '-',
               and '/' keys.

          A    Toggles the plane display mode.

          T    Go to the sector of the specified plane.  _V_e will
               prompt for the plane number.

          +    Display information on the next ship/plane in the
               sector. Ships/planes are ordered by their ship/plane
               number.

          -    Display information on the previous ship/plane in the
               sector.

          /    Display information on the flagship/lead-plane in that
               sector (ship/plane with the lowest number).



          Moving along routes
               You can walk along delivery routes by setting up the
               desired route with the `r' command and then typing the
               `w' command.  The cursor will then move along the
               chosen delivery route.

          r    Designate a current route.

          w    Walk along the current route.

          Levels and Cutoffs
               Levels and cutoffs can be displayed per sector. There
               is some dependency on which mode (aircraft/ship etc) is
               in use at the time.

          L    Toggles the level/cutoff display. This is a 3 stage
               toggle that cycles through a display of commodities,
               distribution thresholds and delivery cutoff values.
               These are only displayed if there is data available.
               Otherwise the commodities are shown.

          Certain options can be put in a profile file. The profile is
          read each time _v_e starts up. The name of the profile
          defaults to ._v_e-_p_r_o_f in your home directory. This can be
          overridden by the environment variable _V_E_P_R_O_F_I_L_E or from the
          command line with the -p switch.

          It is possible to read in an additional, _s_p_e_c_i_a_l file,
          containing special information of an arbitrary nature.  An
          example of this might be the output of a program designed to
          determine which sectors were most likely to develop plague.
          The format of this file must be:
               special
               sector value
                ...
          For instance, a plague output script might look like the
          following (giving plague likelihood in percentage):
               special
               -13,1   82
                -1,3   53
                 0,0   66
                 2,2   29
                 3,-5  44
          The data for these values is put into the _s_p_e field of the
          sector.  _s_p_e can be used in surveys or `?' queries.

          Probably lots

          The `?' command should be identical to that in empire.

          Some contortions of radar scans may not work.

          Surveys with ships may leave survey values on the
          designation map.

          New ship or plane reports don't replace the old values (read
          using the I command).

          Command files that are removed in a forked shell will
          reappear.
